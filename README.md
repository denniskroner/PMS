# PMS
Password Management System Simulation using Bash and Linux

A password management system helps us keep track of all our passwords for different systems, instead of relying on the same password for everything because of poor memory. Here I will provide a password manager on a client-server model to mimic centralised password managers.

The PMS has the the following functions <br>
<b>init</b> Create a new folder to store a user’s passwords. <br>
<b>insert</b> Create a new file in a user’s folder containing the login and password for a service. <br>
<b>edit</b> Edit the credentials. <br>
<b>show</b> Read the information stored for a service. <br>
<b>ls</b> List the services that a user has registered a password for. <br>
<b>remove</b> Delete the file corresponding to a service. <br>
